# Project Title: New York City Attractions

# Audience

My audience for this website are mainly tourists or people interested in New York City who are interested in traveling to New York City but have little knowledge about the region and its places but still plan to add some locations to their itinerary. I noticed that some tourists are unaware of where to travel to in certain boroughs, so having a concise list of tourist attractions will make it more convenient for them to look through and choose. 


# My Planning/Brainstorming

-Create a homepage that helps direct to other pages
-Make individual pages for each borough (5 pages in addition to the home page (6 pages in total))
-Add a navigation bar to navigate between pages
-Add an embedded map of each borough for each designated page
-Add images of tourist sites and a short information description
-Add contact information at footer for users to reach out and use
-Add about us section in footer as well


# Reasoning For Website Content

Typically when people abroad want to build their itinerary for their travels in New York City, they are not really familiar with every borough’s attraction sites. Therefore, I built a website that gave a more convenient approach in finding tourist attractions for NYC. I made sure to provide descriptions of specific tourist sites in each borough for my audience to view and choose a location of interest. The embedded map will also assist my audience in further navigating the place of their liking or to see around the boroughs. For the audience to send in potential feedback and reviews or more assistance, I added a contact information/social media section in my footer.

# My website’s Design layout.

The home page is first seen with a carousel of tourist sites to appeal to my audience. Then, the home page has a question which leads into cards with links of different borough pages. There is also a navigation bar on top with those same borough links. Each borough page has an embedded map the audience can toggle with. This will help them to see where the places are and the directions. Under the map, there are nine provided cards organized with the image of a specific tourist site, the title of the place, and its description. The cards are created in this fashion for my audience to easily view and be informed about each tourist site. Under every page, there is a footer with contact and social media information. Additionally, I made sure my website is responsive enough for my audience to use on different devices. I mainly use CSS and HTML and Bootstrap for my web design.
